Introduction to Streamlit  

Why do we need web interfaces in ML?
Machine learning gives us models, and to use those models we need some kind of graphical interface because not everyone can understand and execute python code.

Real World ML solutions require an interface:
1. Doctors predicting a patient risk
2. Students predicting an exam score
3. Farmers predicting crop prices
4. Finance apps predicting credit risk

Streamlit is one of the simplest way to create ML interfaces without frontend work.
